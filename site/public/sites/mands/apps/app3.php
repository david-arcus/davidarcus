			<h2>Each of our graduate programmes is hard work, fast-paced and always challenging. But by the end of it, you&rsquo;ll understand exactly how M&amp;S works. And you&rsquo;ll be ready to move into a role that could be the start of a long and successful career with us. Here&rsquo;s an overview of how it <br />all works:</h2>

				<p style="margin-top:0px;"><strong class="sky-blue-text">Choosing a scheme</strong><br />
				The majority of our vacancies are for our Retail Management scheme, where you&rsquo;ll work towards becoming a Commercial Manager in one of our stores. You don&rsquo;t need a particular degree, but you do need to be good with people, and have a sound commercial understanding.</p>
 
				<p>We also have a 18-month HR scheme, where you&rsquo;ll spend time with both our in-store and Head Office HR teams. And if you have a relevant degree, you could apply for a Head Office role &ndash; like IT, Design, Buying, Merchandising, Product or Food Technology.</p>
 	
				<p><strong class="sky-blue-text">Getting started</strong><br />
				There are four start dates for the 2013 Retail Management scheme: April, July, September and January 2014. All other graduate roles start in September.</p>
 
				<p>To kick things off, you&rsquo;ll spend a week in your store or chosen area of Head Office. After that, you&rsquo;ll be invited to a graduate induction where you&rsquo;ll meet people from other parts of M&S, and learn more about the company.</p>
				
				<p><strong class="sky-blue-text">During the scheme</strong><br />
				Whichever scheme you choose, you&rsquo;ll work your way through different placements, experiencing a variety of roles within your business area. Nothing&rsquo;s set in stone &ndash; if you need more time on a particular placement or a bit more training in something, no problem. We&rsquo;ll shape the scheme to help you get the most out of it.</p>
				
				<p><strong class="sky-blue-text">After the scheme</strong><br />
				When your scheme ends, you&rsquo;ll have a good understanding of how our business works. You&rsquo;ll also be ready for your first big M&amp;S management role &ndash; perhaps leading a team, or running an area of the business worth millions of pounds. How far you go after that is entirely up to you.</p>
