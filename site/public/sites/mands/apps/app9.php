          <p style="color:#933"><strong>*Applications now closed*</strong></p>
					<p>With this scheme, you&rsquo;ll be managing a department in one of our stores.</p> 
	 
					<p><strong class="sky-blue-text">What will I be doing?</strong><br />
					To prepare you for a Commercial Manager role, you&rsquo;ll try different placements in different areas of our stores, including Food, Clothes, Home and Store Operations. You&rsquo;ll also spend time in HR to learn about our people policies. You&rsquo;ll find out what it takes to lead a team, deal with customers, and handle a multi-million pound budget. All at the same time.</p>
					 
					<p><strong class="sky-blue-text">Where will I be based?</strong><br />
					We&rsquo;ll do our best to place you in a store in your chosen part of the country. But when you finish the scheme, we might ask you to move to another store if we think there are better opportunities for you there. (Don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;ll help towards the costs of relocating).</p>
					 
					<p><strong class="sky-blue-text">What training will I get?</strong><br />
					On each of your placements, you&rsquo;ll get structured training in specific areas. You&rsquo;ll also learn on-the-job alongside experienced managers and colleagues.</p>
					 
					<p><strong class="sky-blue-text">What are you looking for?</strong><br />
					Above anything, you need to be a real people person. You also need to be confident (you&rsquo;ll be talking to customers of all ages and leading a team). It&rsquo;s also important you can think on your feet – seeing where improvements can be made, then having the confidence and determination to make them happen.</p>
					 
					<p><strong class="sky-blue-text">What happens at the end of the scheme?</strong><br />
					At the end of your scheme, you&rsquo;ll be ready to take on a role as a Commercial Manager. You&rsquo;ll take charge of a team of section managers, and run an area of the salesfloor. If you prefer, you could take on an Operational Manager role, where you&rsquo;ll manage a team behind the scenes. And in the longer term, there are all sorts of career paths you could follow – in retail management, and in other areas of our business.</p>

					<p>Our Buyers find and develop all the products that M&S customers love.</p>
					 
					<p><strong class="sky-blue-text">What will I be doing?</strong><br />
					During the scheme (which includes approximately 12 months of training), your role will be &rsquo;Trainee Assistant Buyer&rsquo;. You&rsquo;ll work with one of our buying teams – for example, Food, Womenswear or Home – to find new products and develop them until they&rsquo;re ready to be sold in our stores, always working a few seasons ahead.</p>
					 
					<p>Your day-to-day job will vary depending on which team you&rsquo;re with. But it&rsquo;s likely you&rsquo;ll be involved in briefing designers, working with our suppliers, testing concepts, and helping to launch new products.</p>
					 
					<p><strong class="sky-blue-text">Where will I be based?</strong><br />
					You&rsquo;ll be working at our Head Office in London.</p>
					 
					<p><strong class="sky-blue-text">What training will I get?</strong><br />

					<p><strong class="sky-blue-text">What are you looking for?</strong><br />
					You should ideally have a food or fashion-related degree though we will consider other courses if you&rsquo;ve got retail experience. You also need to be confident and organised - things can get hectic in buying teams, especially just before a range launches. And, as you&rsquo;ll be dealing with suppliers and designers regularly, you need to be good at getting on with people and explaining your thoughts clearly.</p>
					 
					<p><strong class="sky-blue-text">What happens at the end of the scheme?</strong><br />
					At the end of your 12 months, you&rsquo;ll be ready to be an Assistant Buyer, with responsibility for a small range within one of our departments. From there, you&rsquo;ll slowly take on more responsibility until you&rsquo;re ready to become a fully-fledged buyer, taking responsibility for a specific area within a department.</p>

					<p>Our design teams work across all our product ranges. In both departments, you&rsquo;ll try research and creative roles. You&rsquo;ll investigate new trends and materials, and design new products that could end up on our rails.
					 
					<p><strong class="sky-blue-text">What will I be doing?</strong><br />
					As a Graduate Assistant Designer, you&rsquo;ll spend 18 months getting involved in every stage of the design process. You&rsquo;ll identify new trends and carry out shopping reports. You&rsquo;ll design brand new products. And you&rsquo;ll help choose materials and produce samples for trial.
					Although you&rsquo;ll be working with a team of designers, you&rsquo;ll be given plenty of responsibility. You&rsquo;ll soon be confident producing technical specifications, and you&rsquo;ll also have every opportunity to make your own creative mark on our ranges.</p>
					 
					<p><strong class="sky-blue-text">Where will I be based?</strong><br />
					You&rsquo;ll be at our Head Office in London. But you&rsquo;ll also have the chance to visit our supply base in the UK to see how our clothes and homewares are made.</p>
					
					<p><strong class="sky-blue-text">What training will I get?</strong><br />
					You&rsquo;ll learn all about the design and retail sides of the department by shadowing members of the team and visiting our stores.</p>
					
					<p><strong class="sky-blue-text">What are you looking for?</strong><br />
					You need to have a design-related degree. It would also help if you had some relevant work experience. And you also need to be good with CAD and have some experience using Photoshop and Illustrator.</p>
					 
					<p>You need to be happy working with a close-knit team, but confident enough to work on your own and speak up with your ideas. And it goes without saying that you need to have a strong sense of style.</p>
					 
					<p><strong class="sky-blue-text">What happens at the end of the scheme?</strong><br />
					This scheme is for a set contract of 18 months. When you get to the end of that time, you&rsquo;ll have made lots of contacts at our suppliers, so there&rsquo;s a good chance you&rsquo;ll be offered a job with one of them or in our head office.</p>

					<p><strong class="sky-blue-text">What happens at the end of the scheme?</strong><br />
					After about two years you&rsquo;ll be ready to be an Assistant Technologist. From there we&rsquo;ll give you the chance to work in different areas to get more experience and help you move through different roles when you&rsquo;re ready.</p>
