				<h1>What qualifications do I need?</h1>
				<p>The Retail Management scheme accepts a wide range of degrees. But for the other Head Office schemes, you&rsquo;ll ideally need a degree that&rsquo;s related to the role you&rsquo;ll be doing. Our Programmes page will tell you more.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="app-default-padding app7-faq-answers">
				<h1>Do I need to have graduated recently?</h1>
				<p>No. As long as you&rsquo;ve graduated, it doesn&rsquo;t matter how long ago it was.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="app-default-padding app7-faq-answers">
				<h1>Can I apply for two roles?</h1>
				<p>No, unfortunately you can only apply for one. Our programme descriptions and profile videos should help you decide which position you&rsquo;d be best suited to.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="app-default-padding app7-faq-answers">
				<h1>How long does the scheme last?</h1>
				<p>Our Retail Management scheme usually lasts for 9-12 months, although it could be slightly longer depending on how fast you move through your placements. Our other schemes are between 12 months and three years.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="app-default-padding app7-faq-answers">
				<h1>When does the scheme start?</h1>
				<p>The Retail Management scheme has four start dates: April, July, September and January 2014. Most of our other schemes start in September.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="app-default-padding app7-faq-answers">
				<h1>Where will I be based?</h1>
				<p>If you&rsquo;re going to be based in one of our stores, we&rsquo;ll do our best to place you in your chosen part of the country. But when you finish the scheme, it&rsquo;s likely you&rsquo;ll have to move to another store in the UK. (We&rsquo;ll help towards the costs of relocating).</p>
				<p>IT graduates will be based at two locations: our IT centre in Stockley Park, near Heathrow, and our Head Office in Central London.</p>
				<p>All Head Office roles are in Central London.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="app-default-padding app7-faq-answers">
				<h1>What hours will I have to work?</h1>
				<p>Work at M&amp;S is not about clocking in and clocking out. Generally, you&rsquo;ll be working about 40 hours a week, but there will be times when you may need to work outside your normal hours to get the job done. The time you start and finish might vary, depending on your role and what you&rsquo;re working on.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="app-default-padding app7-faq-answers">
				<h1>Do I have to wear a uniform?</h1>
				<p>No, but if you&rsquo;re based in one of our stores, you&rsquo;ll have to wear M&amp;S clothes. (You&rsquo;ll get a big discount).</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="app-default-padding app7-faq-answers">
				<h1>Can I stay at M&amp;S after the scheme?</h1>
				<p>Plenty of our graduates go on to have great careers with M&amp;S.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="app-default-padding app7-faq-answers">
				<h1>Is there a long-term career for me at M&amp;S?</h1>
				<p>Yes. Lots of our most senior managers have been with us for many years. Like them, you&rsquo;ll be given opportunities to try different roles, different areas of the business, and even different countries. The only limit is your ambition.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="app-default-padding app7-faq-answers">
				<h1>What&rsquo;s the social life like?</h1>
				<p>It&rsquo;s as good as you make it. You&rsquo;ll probably find that you go out with your colleagues quite regularly. And it&rsquo;s likely you&rsquo;ll be invited to events with M&S graduates from across the country.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="app-default-padding app7-faq-answers">
				<h1>Where can I find out more about M&amp;S?</h1>
				<p>Have a look at our <a href="http://corporate.marksandspencer.com" target="_blank">corporate website</a>.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="app-default-padding app7-faq-answers">
				<h1>What&rsquo;s the closing date?</h1>
				<p>The closing date for all schemes is December 2012.</p>
