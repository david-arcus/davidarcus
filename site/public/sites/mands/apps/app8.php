					<p style="margin-top:0px;"><strong class="blue-text">Retail Management (12 months, starting in September)</strong><br />
					Based in one of our stores, you&rsquo;ll work on live projects such as leading a seasonal launch as well as workshops, coaching and independent learning. It&rsquo;s hard work and it&rsquo;s not always 9-5, with most stores open during the evening and at weekends. But it&rsquo;s all worth it. Not only do you get top-notch experience as part of a leading retailer; it&rsquo;s also the chance to see if we&rsquo;re the perfect match for each other. If we are, then we&rsquo;ll invite you back to join our Graduate Scheme once you&rsquo;ve finished your studies.</p>
 
					<p><strong class="blue-text">Human Resources (12 months, starting in September)</strong><br />
					You&rsquo;ll get to experience different areas of our business, whether working with our regional HR business partners, working on a Commercial project with one of our store teams or spending time with one of our regional Policy teams. You&rsquo;ll also get to work alongside our specialist teams in London and Salford Quays. It&rsquo;s a great insight into both the commercial and the people side of M&S; from People Policy to Learning and Development. We&rsquo;re refreshing the HR graduate scheme for 2013, so if you&rsquo;re successful during the placement, you could be one of the first we invite back to join us on the new scheme.</p>
 
					<p><strong class="blue-text">E-commerce (12 months, starting in September)</strong><br />
					Our vision is to become a leading international, multi-channel retailer, offering our online customers a seamless high quality shopping experience they won&rsquo;t find anywhere else. On this placement, you&rsquo;ll put your commercial instinct, analytical skills and logical mind to the test on a variety of projects, seeing how ecommerce works in a live, large-scale environment. It&rsquo;s the chance to show your potential as one of our future leaders, with the vision to help us drive this part of the business. </p>
 
					<p><strong class="blue-text">Food Technology (6 months, starting in July)</strong><br />
					You&rsquo;ll work alongside our food technology experts, testing existing products as well as making sure our new ones are safe and tasty and meet our customers&rsquo; high expectations. If you&rsquo;ve got a real passion for food, then this is for you; ideally you&rsquo;re already studying a food related qualification, and looking for insight into the industry with the nation&rsquo;s favourite. And at the end of the scheme, we&rsquo;ll help arrange a placement for you with one of our suppliers to give you even more experience.</p>
 
					<p><strong class="blue-text">Food Product Development (6 months, starting in July)</strong><br />
					When it comes to safe, high quality and tasty food, we lead the way. On this placement, you&rsquo;ll work with a team of experts developing delicious new products our customers will love, and improving the ones they already do. Ideally you&rsquo;re already studying a food related qualification, so from the kitchen to the factory you can put your passion to work and gain valuable industry experience. And at the end of the scheme, we&rsquo;ll help arrange a placement for you with one of our suppliers to give you an even greater insight.</p>

					<p><strong class="blue-text">Per Una (12 months, starting in July)</strong><br />
					Whether you choose a Trading, Merchansiding, Buying or Design placement, you&rsquo;ll gain invaluable experience and insight into this iconic brand. From reviewing store sales and stock as part of the Trading or Merchandising teams, to seeking inspiration for our next designer collection as part of our Design or Buying teams, you&rsquo;ll be at the forefront of our fashion business. </p>

					<p>To join our Trading scheme, you&rsquo;ll ideally be studying an analytical, business or merchandising related degree, or a fashion related degree for a placement with our Buying team. And if you&rsquo;re interested in a Design placement, then you&rsquo;ll be studying a fashion design related degree.</p>
 
					<p>All Per Una placements are based at Head Office in Paddington, London.</p>
 
					<p><strong class="blue-text">Product Design &ndash; Clothing or Lingerie (12 months, starting in July)</strong><br />
					Our design teams develop the quality, cutting edge clothing products that our customers expect. Ideally studying textiles/garment or lingerie/contour design design, you&rsquo;ll work alongside them on a number of live projects; whether it&rsquo;s researching trends, materials and production techniques, refining existing designs or testing new ones.</p>

					<p style="margin-top:0px;"><strong class="blue-text">How long do the business placements last?</strong><br />
					Almost all our placements last for 12 months, starting in July. Our placements for Food Product Developers and Food Technologists last for six months, and runs from July to December.</p>
					 
					<p><strong class="blue-text">How do the placements work?</strong><br />
					Whichever area you&rsquo;re in, your placement will start with an induction programme, where you&rsquo;ll learn all about M&amp;S. After that, you&rsquo;ll go on training courses, and get stuck in to your day-to-day role.</p>
					 
					<p><strong class="blue-text">Do I get paid? </strong><br />
					Yes. Business placement students get &pound;17,500 &ndash; &pound;19,500.</p>
					 
					<p><strong class="blue-text">What happens at the end of the placement? </strong><br />
					When you&rsquo;ve finished your placement, we&rsquo;ll assess how you got on. If you&rsquo;ve done well and shown that you have potential to go further, we&rsquo;ll invite you back to join our graduate scheme when you&rsquo;ve finished your degree.</p>
					 
					<p>Before you start the graduate scheme, you&rsquo;ll go on a three-month programme especially for people who have already done an M&amp;S placement. This will give you the chance to settle back in and learn about anything new.</p>
					 
					<p><strong class="blue-text">Is it the same for the Food Product Development and Food Technology placements? </strong><br />
					Not quite. At the end of your six months, we can help you arrange another six-month placement with one of our suppliers.</p>
					 
					<p><strong class="blue-text">What&rsquo;s the closing date? </strong><br />
					<a href="https://static.wcn.co.uk/company/marksandspencer/graduates/GraduateSearchEngine.html">Applications</a> for our 2013 business placements close in December 2012.</p>
